# Smart City Bus Stop Dashboard: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the thought process, feature breakdown, and technical considerations for building a smart city bus stop dashboard accessible to unauthorized users (public display). The dashboard will provide real-time transit information, accessibility features, and support for multiple languages.

---

## 1. Real-Time Bus Tracking

- **Goal:** Display live bus locations on a map and show ETAs for upcoming buses at the stop.
- **Data Source:** Integrate with a GPS-enabled transit API or backend service providing real-time bus positions and ETAs.
- **Frontend:**
  - Map component (e.g., using Mapbox, Leaflet, or Google Maps API)
  - List of upcoming buses with ETAs
- **Backend:**
  - Poll or subscribe to real-time bus data
  - Predictive analytics for ETA calculation (if not provided by API)
- **Challenges:**
  - Handling data latency and API errors
  - Smooth map updates and marker animations

## 2. Live Service Alerts

- **Goal:** Notify users of delays, detours, or disruptions.
- **Data Source:** Transit authority alert feed (e.g., GTFS-RT, custom API)
- **Frontend:**
  - Prominent alert banner or modal
  - Color coding for severity
- **Backend:**
  - Fetch and cache alerts
  - Filter alerts relevant to the current stop/routes

## 3. Route and Schedule Information

- **Goal:** Display all routes serving the stop and their scheduled times.
- **Data Source:** Static GTFS data or API
- **Frontend:**
  - Route list with schedules
  - Fallback to static schedule if real-time data is unavailable
- **Backend:**
  - Serve static schedule data
  - Merge with real-time data when available

## 4. Transfer Information

- **Goal:** Show transfer points and arrival times for connecting routes/modes.
- **Data Source:** GTFS transfer data, real-time feeds
- **Frontend:**
  - Transfer options with ETAs
  - Visual indicators for easy navigation
- **Backend:**
  - Calculate and display optimal transfer options

## 5. Multilingual Support

- **Goal:** Support English and Dzongkha language switching.
- **Frontend:**
  - Language toggle button
  - All UI text and data labels translatable
- **Backend:**
  - Use i18n library (e.g., next-i18next)
  - Maintain translation files for both languages

## 6. Audio Announcements (TTS)

- **Goal:** Read out on-screen information for visually impaired users.
- **Frontend:**
  - TTS activation button
  - Use Web Speech API or similar for browser-based TTS
- **Backend:**
  - Optionally, pre-generate audio for static content
- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure all dynamic content is accessible via TTS

## 7. High-Contrast and Large Fonts

- **Goal:** Ensure readability in all lighting conditions and for users with visual impairments.
- **Frontend:**
  - High-contrast color themes
  - Large, scalable fonts
  - Toggle for high-contrast mode
- **Accessibility:**
  - WCAG-compliant color and font choices

## 8. Bus Card Balance Checking

- **Goal:** Allow users to check their bus card balance by entering a card ID.
- **Frontend:**
  - Input field for card ID
  - Display balance or error message
- **Backend:**
  - API integration with card balance service
  - Secure, read-only access (no authentication required)

---

## General Considerations

- **Security:**
  - No sensitive data or user authentication required for public dashboard
  - Sanitize all user inputs (e.g., card ID)
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize for fast load times and smooth updates
  - Cache static data where possible
- **Resilience:**
  - Graceful fallback for network/API failures
  - Offline schedule display if real-time data is unavailable
- **Accessibility:**
  - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Next Steps

1. Define data sources and APIs for real-time and static data
2. Set up project structure and select libraries (mapping, i18n, TTS)
3. Design UI wireframes for all features
4. Implement core features incrementally, starting with real-time tracking and schedule display
5. Add accessibility and multilingual support
6. Test in various lighting and accessibility scenarios
7. Deploy and monitor usage/feedback

This plan will guide the implementation and ensure the dashboard is user-friendly, accessible, and reliable for all passengers.
